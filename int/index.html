                    <h3>Aditi Sharma</h3>
                    <p>"In my stint as Bharat Elect Fellow and then Fellow Lead at Kshetra, I have firstly understood the volatility of the political landscape within India, and the reactions in terms of impact the policy landscape offers. On the political and policy front, I learned of the various ways of data collections and analysis. From going out of the way to find a small piece of essential information and doing so with a backup of a strong team, highlighted for me what Kshetra is all about, trust that you can do the task in entirety. I additionally dealt with research, opinion pieces, of gap analysis of swot analysis and different methodologies used in a non-partisan organisation. On a massive scale, I have understood what management is all about - the honing of communication within a diverse demographic. The added advantage that Kshetra often provides is moving around the vertical.While occupied in detailed research, I would often be involved in things that piqued my interest, like content writing, rearching , or even human resources work. It was fantastic to do exploratory tasks that catered to my interests. In short, I have learned of the importance that delegation offers, and the comfort of having brainstorming sessions with my fellows to resolve an issue. In all honesty, the skills you develop here are valuable."</p>

                    <h3>Mudavath Gnaneshwar</h3>
                    <p>"My time at Kshetra Consulting has been an invaluable experience that has greatly enhanced my political knowledge and provided me with first-hand exposure to the internal and external dynamics of Indian Politics. As a fellow, I have been responsible for utilizing research, design, and innovative methods and tools to produce deliverables tailored to the unique socio-political and cultural landscape of parliament, as per the client's requirements. This has involved managing and monitoring the implementation of critical assembly and parliament reports and developing strategic social and media outreach to accelerate the dissemination of the party's manifesto and key leadership messaging. Importantly, this work has given me profound insight into how policies impact diverse sections of the population, which will be instrumental in my upcoming LAMP fellowship, where I will have the opportunity to work closely under a member of parliament. This journey has allowed me to engage with and learn from the dynamic leaders of different ideological persuasions. I gained a valuable understanding of their intentions and priorities for their respective constituencies."</p>

                    <h3>Avinashram</h3>
                    <p>"It was insightful to work as a media analyst for a Kshetra consultancy. In order to assess audience engagement and sentiment, my position entailed creating content, actively monitoring social media channels, and analyzing stats. Every day presented fresh difficulties, such as developing messaging that captivated listeners or managing the constantly shifting social media algorithmic environment. It was thrilling and satisfying to work with the team to improve plans based on data insights. It requires an acute attention to detail, a comprehension of the behavior of the audience, and the capacity to quickly adjust to new trends. Even though the work was intense, it was quite fulfilling because we knew that our efforts were essential in influencing political narratives and provoking thought-provoking discussions."</p>
